<h2>Description</h2>
<p>A churro is a cinnamon- and sugar-topped fried pastry dough stick with Spanish<br>
    and Portuguese origins. Churros are similar to doughnuts, but they have ridges<br>
    because they are piped out of a pastry bag. Because they are fried instead of <br>
    baked, churros have a fluffy and tender interior with a satisfyingly crispy<br>
    exterior.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li> 1 cup water</li>
        <li>2 ½ tablespoons white sugar</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 quarts oil for frying</li>
        <li>½ cup white sugar, or to taste</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
    </ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li> <strong>Step 1</strong>
        <p>Combine water, 2 1/2 tablespoons sugar, salt, and 2 tablespoons vegetable oil <br>
            in a small saucepan and place over medium heat. Bring to a boil and remove from<br>
            the heat. Stir in flour, stirring until mixture forms a ball.</p>
    </li>
    <li> <strong>Step 2</strong>
        <p>Heat oil for frying in a deep fryer or deep pot to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</p>
    </li>
    <li> <strong>Step 3</strong>
        <p>Transfer the dough to a sturdy pastry bag fitted with a medium star tip. Carefully<br>
            pipe a few 5- to 6-inch strips of dough into the hot oil; work in batches so you <br>
            don't crowd the fryer. Cook until golden; use a spider or slotted spoon to<br>
            transfer churros to paper towels to drain.</p>
    </li>
    <li> <strong>Step 3</strong>
        <p>Combine 1/2 cup sugar and cinnamon. Roll drained churros in cinnamon and <br>
            sugar mixture.</p>
    </li>
