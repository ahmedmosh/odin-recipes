<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This is my family's favorite Christmas dinner. <br>
    Elegant for dinner parties or a romantic dinner for two. <br>
    If you desire crabmeat instead of lobster, go for it!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li> 4 (8 ounce) filet mignon (beef tenderloin)

        <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>

        <li>½ teaspoon garlic powder</li>

        <li>4 slices bacon</li>

        <li>½ cup butter, divided</li>

        <li>1 teaspoon OLD BAY® Seasoning</li>

        <li>8 ounces lobster tail, cleaned and chopped</li>

    </ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li> <strong>Step 1</strong>
        <p>Set oven to Broil at 500 degrees F (260 degrees C).</p>
    </li>
    <li> <strong>Step 2</strong>
        <p>Sprinkle tenderloins all over with salt, pepper, and garlic powder. <br>
            Wrap each filet with bacon, and secure with a toothpick.<br>
            Place on a broiling pan, and broil to desired doneness, 
            about 8 to 10 minutes per side for medium rare.</p>
    </li>
    <li> <strong>Step 3</strong>
        <p>While tenderloins are cooking, melt 1/4 cup of butter over medium heat with 1/2 teaspoon Old Bay® seasoning. <br>
            Stir in chopped lobster meat, and cook until done. <br>
            Spoon lobster meat over cooked tenderloins, 
            and return them to the broiler until the lobster meat begins to brown.</p>
    </li>
    <li> <strong>Step 4</strong>
        <p>WWhile the lobster is in the oven,
             heat the remaining 1/4 cup of butter in a small saucepan over medium-high heat, 
             cook until it browns, turning the color of a hazelnut. 
             To serve, spoon the browned butter over the steaks, and sprinkle with the remaining Old Bay® seasoning.</p>
