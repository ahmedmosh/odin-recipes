This project is to practice all of the HTML knowledge i have acquired.
 In this project, i am  going to build a basic recipe website.

The website will consist of a main index page which will have links to a few recipes. The website won’t look very pretty by the time i have finished. 

But it’s important to keep in mind that this project is just to build my HTML chops; i  will revisit this project in the future to style it up with CSS
